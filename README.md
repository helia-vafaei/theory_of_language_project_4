In this program, a calculator is made using PDA, which receives a mathematical expression as an input and if it is valid displays the calculated value, otherwise, prints the INVALID message.
<br>
Your calculator must have the following operators:
<br>
1. Brackets: ) , (
<br>
2. Four main operations: + , âˆ’ , * , /
<br>
3. Power: ^
<br>
4. square root: sqrt
<br>
5. Trigonometric functions: sin , cos , tan , cos , tan
<br>
6. Absolute function: abs
<br>
7. Exponential functions: exp , ln
# input
Program input consists of a line which is a string of numbers, operators and parentheses.
# outpu
If the input is valid, it should be displayed in the resulting line. Otherwise, INVALID should be printed.
# example
input 1:
sin(ln(5 ^ 6 * 3 - cos(sin(6))))
<br>
output 1:
-0.97
<br>
input 2:
(10 + 9) * 4)
<br>
output 2:
<br>
INVALID
